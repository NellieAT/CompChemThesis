# CompChemThesis
Clean yet hyper-flexible MSc thesis template (developed in LaTeX via Sublime Text 3) 

Intended for computational chemists 🖥️⚗️ and materials scientists 📚🥼

Q) Do you want to avoid wasting precious time faffing around with LaTeX formatting? Are you completely new to LaTeX? 

A) This template should help! Popular required maths and science packages have been enabled in the template.

This project includes:
- The main .tex file (where you write your project and attach images)
- The accompanying .bib file (where you carefully list references)
- Generated .pdf document based on the two files above

For best results, please ensure your Sublime Text system check matches the screenshot as closely as possible.

Note, references are in RSC style https://edu.rsc.org/resources/how-to-reference-using-the-rsc-style/1664.article

For those wondering, yes, I was awarded a Distinction for my Research Dissertation. 

With the help of this template you could also obtain a high score!

Good Luck!
