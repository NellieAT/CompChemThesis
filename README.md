# CompChemThesis
Clean yet flexible MSc thesis template (developed in Sublime Text 3 for LaTeX) intended for computational chemists 🖥️⚗️ and materials scientists 📚🥼

Do you want to avoid wasting precious time faffing around with LaTeX formatting? Are you completely new to LaTeX? this template should hopefully help!

This project includes:
- The main .tex file (where you write your project and attach images)
- The accompanying .bib file (where you carefully list references)
- Generated .pdf document based on the two files above

Note, references are in RSC style https://edu.rsc.org/resources/how-to-reference-using-the-rsc-style/1664.article
For those wondering, yes, I was awarded Distinction for my Research Dissertation. With the help of this template you could also obtain a high score!
Good Luck!
